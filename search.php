                    <h3>It's really simple,</h3>
                    <p>
						Just use the left (below on mobile devices) panel on <b>any</b> page of this website to perform a search for public toilets within the Brisbane suburbs.
					</p>
					<p>
						<b>Hint:</b> If the name location is left blank, the search will attempt to find all toilets within the specific suburb.
						This allows for easy access to entire suburbs of toilets.
					</p>
